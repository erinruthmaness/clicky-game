This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This application is a memory game created with React. The application renders different images to the screen, each of which listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score, which increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

The challenge? Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order!

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
